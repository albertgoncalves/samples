                <p>Display MTA subway line by typing in the given character (press <code>r</code> for the <strong>R</strong> line, etc.). While subway lines will accumulate on the map, the subway entrances will narrow to only those that feature all the selected lines (or none if there are no connections). Press <code>esc</code> to reload the page, <code>y</code> to re-center the viewpoint. A little buggy in Firefox; best viewed in Chrome.</p>

                <p>Scraped and processed data for every pass made during the 2018 World Cup. These custom visualizations show the relative passing frequency across the football pitch, for both the passes the given team completed and the passes by their aggregated opposition.</p>
                <p>The area of play was segmented into a large grid, allowing for location-specific passing rates to be computed for all teams and compared to tournament average. These rates were then interpolated in a manner similar to a kernel density plot. Matplotlib put up a fight.</p>

                <h3>All work, no play | August 2018</h3>
                <p>Given two street addresses and a time of day, this simple script will open up an automated instance of Chrome, head over to Google Maps, and click throw the page until it has the route between the given points at the particular time, returning the distance and travel time of the fastest route.</p>
                <p>Put together as part of a work-related research project, this scraping automation was used to check the distance and travel time between all permutated pairs of points from a large collection of locations, with the ultimate purpose of assembling a route which minimized distance and time without skipping any of the destinations.</p>
                <p>Turns out, it's good to leave home around <strong>3:00am</strong> if you want to beat the rush.</p>
