                <p>Display MTA subway line by typing in the given character (press <code>r</code> for the <strong>R</strong> line, etc.). While subway lines will accumulate on the map, the subway entrances will narrow to only those that feature all the selected lines (or none if there are no connections). Press <code>ESC</code> to reload the page, <code>y</code> to re-center the viewpoint. A little buggy in Firefox; best viewed in Chrome.</p>

                <p>Scraped and processed data for every pass made during the 2018 World Cup. These custom visualizations show the relative passing frequency across the football pitch, for both the passes the given team completed and the passes by their aggregated opposition.</p>
                <p>The area of play was segmented into a large grid, allowing for location-specific passing rates to be computed for all teams and compared to tournament average. These rates were then interpolated in a manner similar to a kernel density plot. Matplotlib put up a fight.</p>
